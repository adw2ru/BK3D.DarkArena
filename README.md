# BK3D.DarkArena
Second version of BK3D.Arena game

Whats new?
1. Ligth effects on walls&floors
2. Monsters now in colour
3. Monsters now sorted in depth
4. Engine supports separate thread for game logic

Look at p.4: now it's possible to run faster computers more accuracy. 

A 3D first person shooter on the BK0010? Is it possible? Yes! Despite having only 16K of RAM for the program and a 3MHz processor clock speed, dating back to the early 80s. Imagine that technically this could have existed already in 1985!

System req.:

BK0010, BK0010-01, BK0011M (w/ ANDOS, MKDOS)
